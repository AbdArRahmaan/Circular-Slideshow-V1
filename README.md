# Circular-Slideshow-V1

This is a circular slideshow using HTML, CSS and JS.
The background changes colors with the controller, and it has many visually appealing animations.
The controllers can be toggled back and forth by the right and left icon by clicking, or by the right and left arrow keys.
Attached video shows the project in full detail.
